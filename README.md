The Excel eater is a program that allows you to take values from one workbook and inject them into the correct place in another workbook.  When you have 300 serial numbers associated with notes in 3 different books that need to be compiled to a master, this is great for that.  Some may be missing from the master, some may have units the master doesn't have.  You just want to make sure you're getting everything consumed into the master -- in the right spot.

How to use:
-Input the "Master" Workbook
-Input the target sheet name
-Input the index column letter in the master (serial, idnumber, contact name, phone number, email, product, etc) that will be compared to the child

-Input the "Child" Workbook
-Input the index column letter that will be compared to master
-Set the number of values you wish to extract from the child
-Input the column letter for each value you're extracting (cannot conflict)

-add or discard missing
